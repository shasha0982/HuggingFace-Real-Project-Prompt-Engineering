LNpAovroGe,"This quilt, that my mother made, 
 
 Still makes me think to this day. 
 
 It's softest brown, and brightest blue, 
 
 The curved stitch here, reads `` made it May''. 
 
 It's hard to see, but believe me it's true, 
 
 That's not just a cloth but a piece of shirt. 
 
 You can see a logo here, and right there, 
 
 And a signature over there, someone named `` Bert''. 
 
 This is my favorite part, a piece from a stuffed bear. 
 
 I think it was my mother's favorite too, 
 
 She always said so at least. 
 
 Something from when she was two, 
 
 Given by her grandad for Thanksgiving feast. 
 
 My dad added this, a little button pin, 
 
 Something from his mother, for being a scout. 
 
 Apparently she went to a store and fished in a bin, 
 
 Until night that day, to teach him what love was about. 
 
 I'm sorry you had to see this, 
 
 but their funeral was delayed. 
 
 
 

","Regency Romance: Model the text on a Regency romance novel, focusing on social gatherings, romantic pursuits, and the strict manners of the era.","The softest brown and brightest blue quilt, crafted by the loving hand of a mother, evokes vivid memories in my mind. The curved stitch, delicately etched upon its surface, bears the inscription ""made it May,"" a testament to the passage of time. Though the fabric may be veiled in mystery, I firmly believe that this quilt is not merely a cloth but a treasured heirloom, imbued with love and sentiment.

The intricate logo and signature, meticulously woven into the quilt's fabric, reveal the name ""Bert,"" a symbol of the owner's identity. This precious artifact, once a part of a stuffed bear, holds a special place in my heart. It was my mother's favorite, a cherished relic from her youth, gifted to her by her grandfather during a Thanksgiving feast.

My father added his own touch to the quilt, a pinned button that symbolized his mother's unwavering spirit and her dedication to scouting. Apparently, she spent the entire night fishing in a store bin, determined to teach her son about the profound emotion of love.

I regret that you had to witness this personal tragedy, but I find solace in knowing that their funeral was delayed, allowing for more precious memories to be made."
nnuxwwThWi,"It's the job of our agency to keep track of the worlds monsters and keep them locked down. Which is complicated because people are n't allowed to know they exist or that they create them. 
 
 Fear itself, when amplified by a large amount of people, fearing that same thing enough... produces a monster to represent it, it simply comes to life and exists. We stop said Monsters from destroying us. We always do. 
 
 
 This time just over a decade ago, our job got a lot harder, a new breed of monster had appeared, and it was more dangerous than we ever suspected possible. 
 
 The thing about the old monsters is they're like the fear they represent: 
 
 Werewolves were simply animals, animals that stick to the forest, they're easy to explain to locals and generally do n't even cause much trouble so long as they're left well enough alone, we picked off the aggressive ones and left the rest alone. 
 
 Vampires were a problem for a long while, because like the aristocracy they represented, they liked to lord it over people. To show off their power. Made it very hard to keep them a secret, but also easy to find them and destroy them before the fear they created spread too far. The few around today only stay alive because they do n't act like the monsters they are, so it has been nightmarishly difficult to finish them off, but they're generally no longer our biggest issue. 
 
 With Modern medicine as it is, zombies went extinct long ago with the fear of disease that created them. 
 They were n't like one would imagine them though, they were slow and stupid sure... but also silent, they'd spread by bite, but not moan or be loud doing it. During the black death they killed as many people as the disease itself as fear of disease produced more than we were able to handle. 
 
 
 However now... a new monster has come about. We did n't even realize it -was- a monster until we captured one. Because they destroy themselves mere seconds after they pop into existence. 
 
 What much of the world knows as'Suicide bombers', we found out their true form. So far as we can tell, there have been few genuine suicidal terrorists acts - 9/11 being the one that caused enough fear of terrorism to bring these monsters into existence. However now they jump into existence wherever there's enough fear and tension and after they die, they've left only more fear in their wake, leading to -more- coming into existence later. 
 
 So if not humans, what are they? Well. They have human faces, and hands... but the rest of them is anything but. Their limbs are made of some kind of shadow and their chest of fire - which when they release to explode and cause mayhem. 
 
 We only captured one after a brave marine tackled one to the ground - it would have made no difference, but in doing so he also accidentally starved the flames of oxygen -just- long enough to stop them becoming intense enough to remain, at which point the being became only shadow. 
 
 The creature is pitiful if it does n't get to die soon after forming - the mask it uses to represent a face swiftly begins to rot, lasting only a minute at most the hands soon mold until they too are shadow. 
 And then... it just dies, it dissipates into the essence that makes up all monsters. 
 
 In a weird fit of irony, their purpose is the same as their fears creators - get as much attention as possible and use it to spread fear. And oh boy have they been doing so... we just ca n't stop them. 
 
 Because one can get over the fear of something that fears the sun, that only comes out on a full moon or is simply countered by modern medication. 
 If things get any worse, if we do n't stop the media spreading the fear -and hence the monsters- we're going to have to fear a whole new ending to the world. 
 
 `` This is the way the World ends, not with a whimper. But with a BANG.''
","Write like Ernest Hemingway: Focus on Hemingway's economical and understated style, with simple, powerful sentences.","The agency's responsibility is to track and contain the monstrous creatures that roam the world. This task proves challenging due to the taboo surrounding their existence and the fear they induce. Fear, amplified by a large number of individuals, breeds a monstrous representation of that fear. We engage in combat against these creatures, ensuring their destruction.

Recently, a decade ago, our work became infinitely more difficult. A new breed of monster emerged, one more menacing than any we had encountered previously. Unlike the old monsters, these creatures are like the fear they represent: animals that embody the wildness of nature, vampires that exploit their power to prey upon others, and zombies whose existence is rooted in the fear of disease.

However, our latest adversary presents a unique challenge. Unlike the old monsters, which are relatively straightforward to identify and defeat, these creatures self-destruct mere seconds after their creation. Their existence is fleeting, yet their destructive force is undeniable.

It is this new monster that has us grappling with the complexities of our job. We did not realize it was a monster until we captured one, for its destruction is instantaneous."
aYmnFCsjKl,"The first punch gets me right in the ribs, knocking the wind out of me. I half-crawl towards him from where I fell on my ass, feeling the flush of adrenaline starting to take hold. 
 
 It's a dirty fight, I suppose. We focus on causing as much pain as possible - cruel to be cruel. He stinks. 
 
 ******** 
 
 The actual first punch was somewhat expected. The sun was hot, uncomfortably so, but we felt obligated to enjoy it. The ground in our neighbourhood was both more and less interesting in the summer. Deep cracks and canyons traced out a huge map that stretched from his backyard to the fabled danger-zone of the main road, but it lacked the fascination of living and moving insects, driven underground by drought. 
 
 What else could two boys do, but fight? It was fun. We laughed afterwards. We compared bruises for weeks; his turned yellow first. 
 If there was blood, I do n't remember it. 
 
 We both of stunk afterwards. Of sweat and dirt and pure heat.

 He's lost weight - or, rather, is in the process of losing it. The bones in his wrists are becoming visible. 
 
 It's summer again, not that you would know with the blinds so thick. They've trapped the air, and it's warm without any real heat. 
 
 Cliché, really, to be like this now. *He was such a nice kid... * Everyone was. Everyone is. I have n't reconnected, run into him on the street; people fall by inches. 
 
 He starts to cry. Not like in the movies. It's mostly snot ( mixed with a little blood ). Drool begins to gather at the corners of his mouth. I have to look away. 
 

","Grimm's Fairy Tales: Adapt the text to mimic the tone and style of the Brothers Grimm's fairy tales, often dark with moral lessons.","In the sweltering sun, the stench of sweat and battle permeated the air. A brutal encounter unfolded beneath the blazing sky, a testament to the folly of youth and the sinister nature of unchecked aggression.

The punch, swift and powerful, left me reeling in agony. I stumbled towards him, my breath expelled in a strangled gasp. The fight, a dance of pain and desperation, was a cruel spectacle. His stench, a potent concoction of sweat and despair, filled my nostrils, a pungent reminder of the consequences of his actions.

The ground beneath us was scorched and barren, devoid of the beauty that once adorned it. As we exchanged blows, the sun cast long shadows across the barren canvas, a grim backdrop for our folly. The air was thick with the scent of sweat and violence, a testament to the intensity of our battle.

In the aftermath of the fight, we both reeked of sweat and dirt. His wounds, superficial yet agonizing, began to heal, a testament to the fleeting nature of youth and the enduring power of forgiveness. But in that moment, there was no room for compassion or remorse.

As the sun dipped behind the horizon, casting long shadows across the land, I couldn't help but reflect on the tragedy that had unfolded. It was a summer of violence, a summer of despair, and a summer of lost innocence. The memory of the fight, etched forever in my mind, served as a cautionary tale, a reminder of the destructive power of anger and the importance of compassion."
ufIVkreRND,"Some nights I lay awake staring at the ceiling. When I wake up I swear I can see your ghost in the corner of my vision. But whenever I turn my head the only thing there is the white wall staring back at me. I think back to the fun we had. Camping in the mountains staring at the stars. Sneaking into the local pool to skinny dip. I didn ’ t know how to live until I found you. Now I can barely remember what it is to live. What it is to feel. I try to go through my day like before. It ’ s harder waking up in an empty bed. Harder only having my music to break the silence as I get ready. But I have to have the music. Without the music I ’ m left alone with only my thoughts. And that is what I try to avoid at all costs. I still work the same desk job you got me. The looks I get going down the hall cut into my soul. Some show pity. Some empathy. After I leave work I go to the bar, the only place that doesn ’ t ask questions. I ’ m not asked how I am. They just give me my vodka and leave me to wallow. I always hope I can drink myself into enough of a stupor that I can actually sleep. Maybe I ’ ll even get lucky and crash on the way home. Then I won ’ t have to answer the questions that are always asked. Or deal with the glances that people shoot but think I don ’ t see. By the time I get home I ’ m usually too drunk to even make it to the bed. But somehow I did last night. And as I fell from consciousness, I thought of you. I thought of falling asleep with you in my arms. I wished for the warmth of your body against mine. I yearned for the comfort of your breath next to me. When I felt the wind against me I passed it off as the window left open. When I felt warmth against me I thought it was the liquor warming me. But now I start to wonder. As I sit here staring at you I question if I ’ m still drunk or the most sober I ’ ve been in weeks. I can ’ t believe all the details that are still there. I can see your beautiful green eyes that I fell in love with. I can see the scar on your palm that you got when you tried to help that stray dog and it bit you. I can see the blood on your head and shirt from where you went through the windshield when we hit the tree. But worst of all I see your mouth stuck open screaming in horror the same way it was as you died next to me. I should have pulled over. I should have stopped to sleep. But I wanted to get home to lay bed with you. Now I know why I ’ ve seen you morning after morning. You miss me as much as I miss you. I think instead of work I ’ ll go back to sleep. I ’ ll slide aside so you can lie next to me. Take you in my arms again. Now I know it wasn ’ t the wind against me. It was you watching me. Watching me sleep in my bed while you sleep in the ground. Well no longer. You ’ re here for me now. I have you in my arms again. I embrace the cold that you bring as much as the warmth that once came with you. At last I will be able to sleep with my sweetheart again. 
 Some Nights - FUN
","High Fantasy Epic: Transform the essay into a high fantasy narrative, complete with elaborate world-building, magic systems, and epic quests.","In the tapestry of the ethereal realm of Eldric, where the whispers of the wind carried secrets untold, there lived a solitary soul named Aric. Once a radiant adventurer, Aric had been shattered by the tragic loss of his beloved companion, a radiant maiden named Luna. The echoes of their shared moments reverberated through his mind like the melodies of a forgotten song.

One fateful night, as the moon cast long shadows across the emerald tapestry of the sky, Aric found himself staring at the ceiling, his thoughts adrift in a sea of memories. As he drifted into slumber, the ghostly presence of Luna danced tantalizingly in the periphery of his vision, yet dissipated upon the awakening of dawn.

The emptiness of his bed greeted Aric each morning, a stark reminder of the life he had once shared with Luna. To fill the void, he turned to music, his soulful soundtrack echoing through the halls of his humble abode. Without the music, he was consumed by his gnawing thoughts, like a ship lost at sea without a compass.

Aric's desk job, a testament to his former self, brought a myriad of painful memories. The looks of pity and empathy he received from his colleagues pierced him like a sharp blade. After leaving work, he sought solace in the intoxicating embrace of the local bar, where he immersed himself in the amber liquid, hoping to numb the pain.

In a fleeting moment of respite, Aric found himself intoxicated beyond oblivion. As he stumbled home, he wished upon the stars, longing for a slumber filled with the warmth and comfort of Luna's presence. Miraculously, he managed to make it to his bed, but the intoxicating scent of alcohol and the echoes of his memories lingered in his mind.

As dawn crept upon the horizon, Aric stared at the ceiling, his thoughts returning to Luna. He recalled their shared moments, from the breathtaking vistas of the mountains to the serene tranquility of the pool. The vivid images danced before his eyes, as if Luna herself were whispering secrets into his ear.

Aric questioned whether he was still drunk or the most sober he had been in weeks. The details of his memories, so vivid in his mind, seemed to blur and fade as if they were a dream. He felt the presence of Luna's emerald eyes, their reflection in his own.

In this enigmatic realm of loss and remembrance, Aric's journey continued, marked by the bittersweet symphony of his broken heart and the enduring power of shared memories. As he stared at the ceiling, the ghosts of his past danced alongside him, a testament to the transformative power of love and the enduring spirit of those who touched our hearts."

It is with great pleasure that I can relay to you, on behalf of The United States Department Of Supernatural Distribution, that you are officially licensed to generation and application of banishment, disappearance, and-* 
 
 The sturdy stationery and pompous print fade from view. Everything is temporarily blurry, and I feel my nose flare and quiver for a moment, before the rest of my body joins in. I'm not much of a crier, and make a pathetic scene for a moment as I let the emotion wash over me. Finally. Finally. Fucking finally. I blink the tears out of my eyes, and hear the soft thud as they land on the paper. I look down again, and next to a tear drop I read, *your superpower will be rendered available as soon as you read aloud the following code: USER556865REQ55432. In accordance with federal law, you must destroy this document upon activation. * 
 
 It is the most amazing, natural thing. I just wave my hand, focus on an object, and.. boom; it's gone. Or transported amazingly to a location of my choosing. It's like magic, except it's not. It's a superpower, and one I can now use to my heart's content. Of course there's laws and regulations, but with great power comes blah blah blah yada ya. I focus on the document for a second before transporting it from my hand to my desk before Vanishing it altogether. So. Damn. Cool. What now? I think the answer to that is pretty obvious. 
 
 The video clip is pretty short, and I filmed it myself. The shot zooms in on my sink overloaded with dishes, two weeks worth. The camera then turns to me, and my frown lets the viewer know that I'm not happy about it. As it turns back to the sink, my hand waves across the frame. Boom, they're gone. To erase any doubt, I open the dishwasher and ta-da, they're neatly stacked on the racks within. The final scene is my smiling face. Facebook. Instagram. Snapchat. Upload, upload, upload. # Lifestough 
 
 Two hours later, I check my posts. One response, and 13 combined likes. Mom says `` congratulations'', but she did n't even put an exclamation mark at the end. My heart sinks. I'm so damn sick of being the last one to every trend. 
 
 I wish my superpower would disappear. 
 
 Just kidding, it's still pretty cool.
","Fairy Tale Villain: Use the menacing and crafty language of a fairy tale villain, plotting against the heroes.","My hand quivered as I clutched the letter, the parchment trembling beneath my grip. It was an official letter, bearing the seal of an agency I had never heard of – The United States Department Of Supernatural Distribution. The words danced across the page, promising me the power to dispel, vanish, and transport. My heart raced with anticipation, a cocktail of fear and exhilaration.

The letter detailed my official licensing to generate and apply ""banishment, disappearance, and transmigration"" – powers hitherto unimaginable. The words ""banishment, disappearance, transmigration"" echoed in my mind like a siren's song, promising me the ability to manipulate reality itself. The paper burned my eyes, and my nose twitched in anticipation of the intoxicating scent of power that I was about to wield.

I read the code, my voice cracking with emotion, and the air crackled with anticipation. As I waved my hand and focused on the document, it vanished. It was as if I had conjured a storm with a single gesture, the object disappearing into thin air. The feeling of accomplishment was overwhelming, and I couldn't contain my tears.

In that moment, I was the master of my destiny, the weaver of fate, the architect of destruction. The world was mine to manipulate, and I was ready to wreak havoc. I knew the power was intoxicating, but I also understood the responsibility that came with it. As I sat back, surveying the wreckage of my kitchen, I felt a sense of satisfaction. This was my moment, my chance to rewrite the rules of the world. And I was going to do it, one dish at a time."
